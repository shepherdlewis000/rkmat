<h3>XML Sitemap</h3>
<p>I used www.xml-sitemaps.com to create one. Have to remember to update this and resubmit to Google upon changes. It's in the root of the web directory as sitemap.xml</p>
<h3>Redirects</h3>
<p>All redirects are handled by .htaccess. Cpanel had a problem doing it some way because https redirect would screw with virtual host
    I think (like at one time we had dev.rkmasonryandtuckpointing.com set up).<br />
    All non http is directed to https and all leading www's are stripped. A copy of .htaccess is saved as htaccess-copy in root of web directory.
</p>
<h3>Note on 404's</h3>
<p>I wrote a custom 404 handler that will do a timed redirect to the homepage while passing the 
    original referrer (having the stale link) and the bad link itself in this format:
    https://rkmasonryandtuckpointing.com/?source=404&referrer=&badPage=https%3A%2F%2Fwhatever.com%2F328 
</p>
<p>Cpanel names it 404.shtml. I dunno where it actually keeps the file, but I'll put a copy of it in root of web directory 
    in case it's ever needed.</p>
<h5>Some of these listings are of files that were auto generated by Bootstrap Studio</h5>
<p>THey've been borrowed from for the Home Page of RKMAT</p>

<h5>IMAGE GALLERY IS Koken</h5>
<p>Located <a href="https:/rkmasonryandtuckpointing.com/pics">HERE</a> for public view</p>
<p> And admin login is <a href="https://rkmasonryandtuckpointing.com/pics/admin">HERE</a></p>
<p>NOTE: IF WE ARE GONNA KEEP USING KOKEN IMAGE GALLERY which is old and not fully functional as it once was
    but perhaps is sufficient - might be good to read this file
    ESPECIALLY IF SWITCHING TO PHP 7 (currently RKMAT is running PHP 5 point ...6 I think): <a href="Fixes-for-Koken-problems.html">Fixes for Koken problems</a>
</p>
</div>

<p> 
    .htaccess still has some Wordpress mod_rewrite stuff. Might need rewrite to use PHP env variables for email.
</p>
<p>
    I removed the href from home page links to pages not ready yet.

    <h4>Hiding email addresses</h4>
    <p>The contact.php form is obfuscated to somewhat hide the hardcoded 
        email addresses.  Website used to obfuscate the file is at 
        <a class="text-light" href="https://www.gaijin.at/en/tools/php-obfuscator">Gaijin.at</a>.
        The original file (purged of email addresses) is at: contact.orig.php
        The scrambled one is stored as both 1) contact.obf.php but also 
        the in-use 2) contact.php

<div class="container bg-danger">
    <p>animIcons.css in the assets/css folder has two animated icons: one a red x that forms in a

        The file <a class="text-light" href="./animIcons-demo.html">animIcons-demo.html</a>
